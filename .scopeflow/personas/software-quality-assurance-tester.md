# Software Quality Assurance Tester

## Goals
- Ensuring that the developed software meets and complies with defined or standardized quality specifications.
- Identifying and documenting product defects and inconsistencies with product functions, output, online screens, or content.
- Collaborating with developers to make corrections and ensure that all problems are resolved before the product goes live.

## Frustrations
- Discovering defects late in the development cycle, which may result in significant rework and delay in product release.
- Lack of clear communication between the QA teams and development teams, which may lead to misunderstanding of requirements and unexpected outcomes.
- Hard to simulate all possible scenarios for functional and non-functional testing due to software complexity or resource limitations.

## Typical Tools
- Defect tracking tools (e.g., Jira, Bugzilla)
- Automated testing tools (e.g., Selenium, TestComplete)
- Test management tools (e.g., qTest, Zephyr)
- Performance Testing Tools (e.g., LoadRunner, Apache JMeter)

## Daily Behaviors
- Creating detailed, comprehensive, and well-structured test plans and test cases.
- Identifying, recording, and tracking software defects and inconsistencies.
- Performing systematic tests to find defects or issues.
- Monitoring and analyzing test results, and reporting and documenting technical issues.
- Communicating with the development team to resolve issues and implement improvements.
